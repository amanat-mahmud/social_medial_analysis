## ❓ Problem Statement
While the social media platform shows active user engagement and clear trends in content preferences, there are opportunities to optimize hashtag usage, leverage influential users, and enhance regional content strategies. The platform faces challenges in balancing the influence of top users, capitalizing on trending topics, and ensuring consistent engagement across different content types and geographical regions. Additionally, there's a need to understand and replicate the success factors of highly bookmarked posts and active commenters to boost overall user interaction and content visibility.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to enhance user engagement, expand the platform's reach, and optimize content strategy across the social media platform. This involves leveraging popular hashtags, nurturing influential users, encouraging active participation, and understanding regional content preferences. The goal is to increase overall user activity, improve content visibility and interaction rates, and create a more balanced and dynamic user ecosystem that fosters growth and engagement across all user segments and geographical areas.
